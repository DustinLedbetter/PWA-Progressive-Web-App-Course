Web App Manifest
The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that informs the browser about your web app. It tells how it should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop. And to show the Add to Home Screen prompt, the web app manifest is required.



In the end, it's just a JSON file with some mandatory and optional properties.

name: When the browser launches the splash screen, it will be the name displayed on the screen.

short_name: It will be the name displayed underneath your app shortcut on the home screen.

start_url: It will be the page shown to the user when your app is open.

display: It tells the browser how to display the app. There are several modes like minimal-ui, fullscreen, browser etc. Here, we use the standalone mode to hide everything related to the browser.

background_color: When the browser launches the splash screen, it will be the background of the screen.

theme_color: It will be the background color of the status bar when we open the app.

orientation: It tells the browser the orientation to have when displaying the app.

icons: When the browser launches the splash screen, it will be the icon displayed on the screen. Here, I used all sizes to fit any device's preferred icon. But you can just use one or two. It's up to you.
