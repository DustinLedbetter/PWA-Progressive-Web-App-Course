A Progressive Web App is a web app that delivers an app-like experience to users by using modern web capabilities. In the end, it's just your regular website that runs in a browser with some enhancements. It gives you the ability:
<br />
<br />To install it on a mobile home screen
<br />To access it when offline
<br />To access the camera
<br />To get push notifications
<br />To do background synchronization
